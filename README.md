# GITHUB SEARCH

Ever want to quickly search for a username on github and find out how many followers they have, or how many public repos they have?
This is a simple search app for github users.

Backend is built using express and node-fetch to get information from Github's API. Frontend is build in react.

( Feature to add: error handling for unvalid search )

## Get Started
Install the dependencies:
```
npm i
```
Then start the development server
```
npm start
```
Then start the client
```
npm start
```

Happy hacking!
